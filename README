## 🚀 The Challenge & Our Solution

The AMD Robotics Hackathon challenges us to push the boundaries of robotics using AMD's cutting-edge hardware.

### The Problem We Tackled
Briefly describe the specific real-world problem or pain point your project addresses.
* *Example: Traditional robotics platforms struggle with the high data throughput and low-latency requirements of modern visual inspection tasks on production lines.*

### How We Solved It
Explain your project's unique approach and how you leveraged AMD technology.

* We implemented a **[Type of Neural Network/Algorithm]** for **[Core Function]**.
* The entire pipeline is accelerated on the **AMD [Specific Hardware - e.g., Kria K26 SOM, Versal ACAP]** using **[Software/Framework - e.g., Vitis AI, ROS 2, OpenCL]**.
* This allowed us to achieve a **[Key Metric - e.g., 50 FPS throughput]** with only **[Low Latency Number - e.g., 10ms end-to-end latency]**, proving the platform's viability for high-speed industrial applications.

## ⚙️ Technical Deep Dive

### System Architecture
Describe the major components of your system and how they communicate.



* **Sensing Layer:** [Camera/Lidar/Sensor] feeds data to the edge device.
* **Processing Core:** The **AMD Kria K26 SOM** handles all AI inference and control logic.
    * **AI Acceleration:** We utilized the **DPU (Deep Learning Processor Unit)** via Vitis AI for image processing.
    * **Real-time Control:** The **[Processor Core, e.g., Cortex-A53/R5]** runs the ROS 2 control nodes.
* **Actuation Layer:** Commands are sent to the **[Motor Controller/Robot Arm]** via **[Communication Protocol - e.g., CAN, Ethernet]**.

## 💻 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:

* AMD Vitis AI [Version]
* ROS 2 [Distro]
* [Specific OS, e.g., Ubuntu 20.04]
* Required Python packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Build and Deployment

Follow these steps to replicate our project:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/awesome-amd-project.git](https://github.com/yourusername/awesome-amd-project.git)
    cd awesome-amd-project
    ```
2.  **Model Compilation (Vitis AI):**
    * Place your trained **[.onnx or .caffemodel]** in the `model/` directory.
    * Run the Vitis AI compiler script:
        ```bash
        ./scripts/compile_dpu.sh
        ```
3.  **ROS 2 Setup:**
    ```bash
    source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash
    colcon build
    source install/setup.bash
    ```
4.  **Run the Demo:**
    ```bash
    ros2 launch robot_control_pkg full_system_launch.py
    ```
    The main control node will initialize the hardware and start the inference pipeline.
